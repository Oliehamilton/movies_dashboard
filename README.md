## 🧠 Design Rationale

This dashboard follows core Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) and data visualisation principles. Visuals are selected based on interpretability and storytelling potential (e.g., bar charts for categorical comparison, line charts for trend analysis). All colours follow psychological guidelines to maintain emotional resonance, particularly suited for the 18–35 age group. The layout structure progressively reveals insights while supporting an exploratory experience.
